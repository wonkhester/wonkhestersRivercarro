# Rivercarro

A slightly modified version of _rivertile_ layout generator for
**[river]**

Compared to _rivertile_, _rivercarro_ adds:

-   Monocle layout, views will takes all the usable area on the screen.
-   Gaps instead of padding around views or layout area.
-   Modify gaps size at runtime.
-   Smart gaps, if there is only one view, gaps will be disable.
-   Limit the width of the usable area of the screen.
-   Per tag configurations.
-   Cycle through layout.

## Building

Same requirements as **[river]**, use [zig] 0.14, if **[river]** and
_rivertile_ works on your machine you shouldn't have any problems.

Build, `e.g.`

    zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local

## Usage

Works exactly as _rivertile_, you can just replace _rivertile_ name by
_rivercarro_ in your config, and read `rivercarro(1)` man page for commands
specific to rivercarro.

`e.g.` In your **river** init (usually `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init`)

```bash
# Mod+H and Mod+L to decrease/increase the main ratio of rivercarro
riverctl map normal $mod H send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-ratio -0.05"
riverctl map normal $mod L send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-ratio +0.05"

# Mod+Shift+H and Mod+Shift+L to increment/decrement the main count of rivercarro
riverctl map normal $mod+Shift H send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-count +1"
riverctl map normal $mod+Shift L send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-count -1"

# Mod+{Up,Right,Down,Left} to change layout orientation
riverctl map normal $mod Up    send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location top"
riverctl map normal $mod Right send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location right"
riverctl map normal $mod Down  send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location bottom"
riverctl map normal $mod Left  send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location left"
# And for monocle
riverctl map normal $mod M     send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location monocle"
# Cycle through layout
riverctl map normal $mod W     send-layout-cmd rivercarro "main-location-cycle left,monocle"

# Add others rivercarro's commands the same way with the keybinds you'd like.
# e.g.
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "inner-gaps -1"
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "inner-gaps +1"
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "outer-gaps -1"
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "outer-gaps +1"
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "width-ratio -0.1"
# riverctl map normal $mod <keys> send-layout-cmd rivercarro "width-ratio +0.1"

# Set the default layout generator to be rivercarro and start it.
# River will send the process group of the init executable SIGTERM on exit.
riverctl default-layout rivercarro
rivercarro -outer-gaps 0 -per-tag &
```
